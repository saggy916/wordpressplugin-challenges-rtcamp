<h3><em>Were you expecting a larger team? Sorry to disappoint, this is a one-man business.</em>
<em> And I pride myself in always have a one-on-one personal connection with my<strong>Â photography blog.</strong></em></h3>
&nbsp;
<h4><strong>This is what I'm passionate about ?</strong></h4>
First and foremost, I'm in love with photography. Otherwise, I wouldn't be working with photographers.

Honing your skills at such a beautiful form of art is difficult enough, but having to deal with all the technical aspects is often overwhelming to many photographers.

I'm here to help with all those aspects, letting you return to the core of your business: shooting great images.
<h4><strong>Why I have the knowledge to help you ?</strong></h4>
Besides studying 14 different programming languages at the saurastra university level, I've always been adept at any technical skills, which made me good with exact sciences (through I'm definitely studying more abstract arts as I grow older).

I'm a quick learner, and that's how I've gotten to know WordPress inside-out and to be proficient in tens of other web-design tools &amp; services. If you've heard of it, I probably already used it.

And I'm always staying in touch with the web-design industry, learning about all the new tools and technologies that appear, sorting through all of the craziness to find the best tools for every project.

<h4><strong>Why I created destiny_world blog ?</strong></h4>
First of all, I empathize with photographers. I also started out as one, didn't know how to promote my work or to make a living out of it.

Secondly, photographers are creative people, and they're spreading something beautiful into the world (their art). The world needs more of that.

destiny_rider_7979 blog is my attempt to improve the photography website standards out there, to help creative photographers with the technical yet important task of building &amp; improving their website.

I try to do that through offering professional web-design services, and through longform articles and an extensive content area, all about photography websites.
